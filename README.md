  - To be honest, AI was used quite a bit on this assignment for learning and error handling purposes. I've never used Django or Bootstrap, so I was unfamiliar with a lot of what to do and what it should look like. I did use the documentation provided as well to help learn and start writing the code. That being said I still wrote a lot of my code, but I did ask AI the keywords and formation of what I should be doing; as well as any error handling and giving me suggestions how to improve the code I wrote to better match the standards of Django and Bootstrap programming. Although I used a lot of AI, this still took me 10+ hours as I was really trying to learn and attempt it on my own before asking AI to help me fix my mistakes and handle any errors that popped up. At the end of the day, I do feel like I learned a lot from this assignment. 
  - I did use AI to help generate code for log in and user authorization as I was completely lost on that part.
